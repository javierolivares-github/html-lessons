    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Legend of Zelda[a] is a high fantasy action-adventure video game franchise created by Japanese game designers
      Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It is primarily developed and published by Nintendo, although some portable
      installments and re-releases have been outsourced to Capcom, Vanpool, and Grezzo. The gameplay incorporates
      action-adventure and elements of action RPG games.
      <br>
      The series centers on the various incarnations of Link, a courageous young Hylian man, with pointy, elf-like ears;
      and Princess Zelda, a magical princess that is the mortal reincarnation of the goddess Hylia; as they fight to
      save the magical land of Hyrule from Ganon, an evil warlord turned demon king, who is the principal antagonist of
      the series. Ganon wishes to use the Triforce, a sacred relic left behind by the three goddesses that created
      Hyrule to remake the world in his own dark image. When gathered together, the power of the Triforce can grant any
      wish its user desires; however, if someone with a heart that does not possess a balance of the three virtues of
      Power, Courage and Wisdom attempts to touch the Triforce, it will split into three triangles and bond with three
      people whose hearts embody the required virtue.<a href="#home">Go Home &rarr;</a>
